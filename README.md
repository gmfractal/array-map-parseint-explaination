Explanation for JavaScript Array map and parseInt problem

In March 2023, JamesQQuick posted a snippet of JavaScript code using the Array.prototype.map method and parseInt that returned a seemingly incorrect result (https://youtube.com/shorts/dXbR7sGFCMc?feature=share).

The problem is that running `["1", "10", "100"].map(parseInt)` will return `[1, NaN, 4]` instead of `[1, 10, 100]`, but why? 

The causes of the problem is explained here with examples.
